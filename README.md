# LeanEVM
A toy implementation of the EVM in Lean4.

## Building

In order to build the LeanEVM, you need to have the Lean4 toolchain
installed (see
[here](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html) for
instructions).

```
% lake update
% lake build
```

This process can take a while to complete, as it compiles all of
Mathlib.
